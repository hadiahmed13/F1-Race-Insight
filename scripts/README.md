# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for the F1 Race Insight project.

## Available Scripts

- `generate_architecture_diagram.py`: Generates the architecture diagram image from ASCII art
- `generate_sample_data.py`: Generates sample data for development and testing
- `generate_sample_model.py`: Creates a sample model for development and testing

## Usage

To run a script:

```bash
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py
```

These scripts are particularly useful when setting up a fresh environment or when you want to test functionality without downloading the full F1 telemetry data.
